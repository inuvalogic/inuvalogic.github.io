### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer who has a wide range of front-end & back-end skills and extensive experience of using object-oriented languages. I have been working in web development domain for 16 years+. I really enjoy writing optimized object-oriented code and I am very good at building and maintaining applications that support the solutions delivered to customers.

I have been working mainly on complex projects as a Senior Software Engineer. As a web developer I worked with PHP Native, Symfony, Zend, Laravel, Codeigniter and Yii Framework. Also I'm using Figma for prototyping the applications.

In my everyday work, I actively use Laravel, MySQL, Django, Javascript, and Figma. The majority of the projects I worked on recently used MySQL and Postgres for database storage, but also my recent experience includes MongoDB and Oracle. I am doing the development jobs under Ubuntu Linux but also have experience with CentOS, Slackware, FreeBSD, even MacOS, and can install and tune the necessary software under Unix-like OSes. I am also using Windows for design/development/testing purposes as well.

I have extensive experience with Apache and Nginx Web servers. Along with that I have worked with Amazon Web Server, Heroku, Digital Ocean and many other server deployments.

In my recent project (2018-now), I'm developing product nutrition's big data project, combining PHP as backend, Vue, Javascript, SCSS for frontend, Postgres for database, Python for scraping & processing the data mainly using TensorFlow, Keras, Tesseract, and Nginx for server.
